        "description": "I'm a Web Developer based in Panambi, Brasil and also an Internet Systems student. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between. I have studied Web Development for about 2 years now, but really dove into it around half a year ago. I have also started freelancing recently while studying at the university and I've manage to gain a decent amount of experience and valuable knowledge mainly in Full-Stack/Front-End Web Development using technologies such as Next.js, React.js, Node.js, etc."
